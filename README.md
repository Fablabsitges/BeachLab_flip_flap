# flip-flap

## About
Flip-Flap is an *Open Source* Mechanical Split Flap Display, AKA *Solari* display.

There are 2 versions. One for using an Arduino microcontroller and another for using the attiny/stepper combo.

## Instructions and documentation
The documentation is open source and it is going to be uploaded to Github. There is one problem though. The old website was exported to **Wordpress XML** and I don't know how to extract posts and images. If anyone can give a hand I would appreciate.
